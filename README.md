## CusToM Workshop
Examples and presentations used during the workshop of the 3rd December in Bruz at the M2S lab. The Workshop deals with the 
[CusToM : a Matlab toolbox for musculoskeletal simulation](https://github.com/anmuller/CusToM) library in Matlab. You can provide your own copy here on the link.

# Tutorials
- [Kinematic Tutorial](#Tuto1)
- [Muscle Forces Tutorial](#Tuto2)
- [XSENS Tutorial](#Tuto3)

The examples are based on a walking motions (normal and altered with an ankle brace) published in a [conference](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02088913/document)

### 1. Kinematic Tutorial<a name="Tuto1"></a>

The first objective of the tutorial is to compare kinematic results from anthropometric calibration and geometrical calibration. 
At the end of the tutorial, key concepts should be understood: rotation sequences, inverse kinematics, reconstruction error, convergence of geometrical calibration.

The second objective of the tutorial is to compare the normal walking gait with the altered gait.

### 2. Muscle Forces Tutorial<a name="Tuto2"></a>

The objective of the second tutorial is to compare muscle force computation from two methods. At the end of the tutorial, key concepts should be understood: inverse dynamics, muscle activation model, cost functions.

### 3. Force Prediction Tutorial <a name="Tuto3"></a>

The objective of the third tutorial is to compare force computation from experimental measurments and force prediction algorithm. At the end of the tutorial, key concepts should be understood: contact points, contribution to dynamic equilibrium.

### 4. XSENS Tutorial <a name="Tuto4"></a>

The objective of the last tutorial is to compare kinematics results between two means: XSENS and Motion capture.
